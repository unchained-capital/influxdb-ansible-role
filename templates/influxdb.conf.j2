### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if

# field and the default value used.  Uncommentting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com

### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place

### [shard-precreation]

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###

### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.
